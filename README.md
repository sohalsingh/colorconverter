# colorconverter


This project provides a function to convert color names to color codes and vice versa. It utilizes the `webcolors` module for the conversion.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to install the `webcolors` module. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install webcolors
```

## Usage

The `color_to_code` function can be used to convert color names to color codes and vice versa.

```python
import webcolors

def color_to_code(color):
    try:
        # Attempt to convert the color name to its corresponding code
        code = webcolors.name_to_hex(color)
        return code
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # Attempt to convert the color code to its corresponding name
            name = webcolors.hex_to_name(color)
            return name
        except ValueError:
            # Invalid color value
            return None

# Example usage
color = "red"
code = color_to_code(color)
if code is not None:
    print(f"The code for the color '{color}' is '{code}'.")
else:
    print(f"Invalid color: '{color}'.")
```

In the example above, the `color_to_code` function is called with the color name "red," and the corresponding color code is printed if it exists.

You can replace `"red"` with any valid color name or code to perform the conversion.
